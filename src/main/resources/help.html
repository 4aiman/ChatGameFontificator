            character still has extra space on its left or right side, the width of each character will include that space as well. Typically older games employ these types of fonts because they are easier to lay out, but the result is sometimes awkwardly
            blocky when periods or commas are buffered with much more space than they would normally take up. Variable width fonts can have different widths per letter. This program calculates the width of all non-transparent pixels per character and makes
            that value the width of that character. Each font has an associated font type: fixed or variable width. When a font is selected, this checkbox will be set automatically to match. However, this can be overridden if you would like a normally
            fixed width font to be variable width, or a variable width font to be fixed width.</td>
