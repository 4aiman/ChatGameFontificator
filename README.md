Chat Game Fontificator [Download](../../raw/master/jar/ChatGameFontificator.jar)

The Chat Game Fontificator (CGF) is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) display that makes the chat look like the text boxes from various video games. Its intended use is as a part of a Twitch video game stream in place of less pretty chat windows.

It's a Java application archive, so you'll need the JRE to run it, but it's likely you already have that. If you don't, you can get it [here](https://java.com/en/download/).

Install the JRE, and then you can run this program.

Enjoy!
