#Chat Game Fontificator [[Download](../../raw/master/jar/ChatGameFontificator.jar)]

The Chat Game Fontificator (CGF) is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) display that makes the chat look like the text boxes from various video games. Its intended use is as a part of a Twitch video game stream in place of less pretty chat windows.

It's a Java application archive, so you'll need the JRE to run it, but it's likely you already have that. If you don't, you can get it [here](https://java.com/en/download/). Install the JRE, and then you can run this program.

Here are some screenshots of some of just a few of the preset game styles:

## More Information for the Especially Curious

* Why did you create this?

I made it mostly for personal use, but decided to just put it out there in the hope that others would find it useful. I think it's ugly to put a plain-looking chat into a Twitch stream, so I made this.

* Isn't it sort of stupid to put the chat in the stream when it's right there next to the stream already?

Yeah, I have tremendous sympathy for that notion. But a chat that isn't displayed in the video is fleeting, so when you watch a stream re-run, it just looks like a crazy person talking to him or herself. And it gives you a better feel for the infamous Twitch stream delay since you can see exactly when the post got to the streamer. And, the sorts of games I like have 4:3 aspect ratios, so there's wasted space anyhow.

* Do you stream? If so, do you eat your own dogf ood?

Yes, I stream, although I haven't for a long time because I was spending my free time coding this. If you're interested in seeing this chat program in action, please come watch me here [GlitchCog at Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/glitchcog/profile).

* How did you choose these games? What about this other game?

The selection of games is informed by what I like and want to stream myself, what I could find images of fonts for, and the random whims of my OCD while putting the font sprite sheets together. I'll likely keep adding more in the future.

* Where are all my emoji? I find myself incapable of expression without absurd little faces!

I'm considering adding them, but it's going to be a bit of work. I personally don't like emoji or even emoticons, and I don't use them myself. But I know that the average Twitch chat is approximately 50% Kappa to 50% actual content, so I understand that my perspective on the matter is firmly the minority view. If I am to include any emoji, I want to build in the option to have them match the fonts, and until I do that, it'll have to wait. I think it's how blurry and pixelated they are. I like sharp edges, like the jagged edges of old video game fonts. I don't want anti-aliased and artifacted stuff in my program. Having said that, if you can't wait, please feel free to take my code and add them in yourself. I won't mind in the slightest.

* What's the difference between these two fonts?

Sometimes not much. Dragon Warrior, for example, just changed a couple letters slightly throughout the series on the NES. Why did I bother with these subtle changes? I'm afraid I have no valid reason other than a sense of completeness. There are additional characters that aren't typically featured in the fonts of older games, so whenever necessary I drew my own dollar signs and tildes, trying my best to match the style of the font.

* Where did you get these font and border images?

I don't own the copyright to the fonts or border art contained in this program, nor do I have permission to use them from the copyright holder. I ripped some out of ROM images of the games, took screenshots of name-entry screens, searched all over the Internet for elusive screenshots that happened to display dialog containing some rare character I was still missing, and found some others searching through sprite rip websites.
